## üéì SEO Strategy Tips

### Featured Snippet Opportunities
- Target keywords with snippets but not owned by you
- Structure content with clear, concise answers
- Use proper heading hierarchy (H2, H3)
- Include lists, tables, and definitions

### PAA Optimization
- Create FAQ sections targeting PAA questions
- Use exact PAA questions as H2/H3 headings
- Provide comprehensive, direct answers
- Link between related PAA topics

### SERP Intent Analysis
- **Local Pack present** = Local business intent
- **Videos present** = Visual/tutorial intent
- **Featured Snippet present** = Quick answer intent
- **Knowledge Panel** = Informational/entity query

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

```python
SERPScraper(
    language='en',    # Search language
    location=''       # Geographic location (future feature)
)
```

### Batch Analysis Parameters

```python
scraper.batch_analyze(
    keywords=['keyword1', 'keyword2'],
    delay=5  # Seconds between requests (recommended: 3-10)
)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Use Cases

### Track SERP Changes Over Time

```python
import schedule

def daily_serp_check():
    scraper = SERPScraper()
    keywords = load_keywords_from_file('target_keywords.txt')
    scraper.batch_analyze(keywords)
    scraper.export_summary_csv(f'serp_{datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d")}.csv')

schedule.every().day.at("09:00").do(daily_serp_check)
```

### Find Featured Snippet Opportunities

```python
# Analyze your target keywords
results = scraper.batch_analyze(keywords)

# Find keywords with snippets you don't own
opportunities = [
    r['keyword'] for r in scraper.results
    if r['featured_snippet']['present'] and 
       'yoursite.com' not in r['featured_snippet'].get('source_url', '')
]

print(f"Featured snippet opportunities: {opportunities}")
```

### PAA Content Ideas

```python
# Extract all PAA questions
all_questions = []
for result in scraper.results:
    if result['people_also_ask']['present']:
        all_questions.extend(result['people_also_ask']['questions'])

# Create content outline
print("Content ideas from PAA:")
for q in set(all_questions):
    print(f"  - {q}")
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Rate Limiting
- Default 5-second delay between requests
- Avoid analyzing 100+ keywords in one session
- Consider spreading large batches across days

### Search Engine Policies
- Tool makes direct HTTP requests to Google
- For production use at scale, consider official APIs:
  - Google Custom Search API
  - SEO tool APIs (SEMrush, Ahrefs)
  - SERP API services

### Data Accuracy
- SERP features vary by location and personalization
- Results may differ from logged-in Google search
- Some features may not be detected due to HTML changes
